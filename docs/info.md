## How it works

This project implements a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) digital baseband receiver designed to work with the SCuM (Single-Chip µ-Mote) platform. 

## How to test

Connect the SCuM chip. The chip as the BLE receiver’s digital baseband. Transmit BLE packets from the SCuM RF front-end and observe decoded packet data on a connected computer via serial output or debugging interface.
